# TO-DO-LIST
published at https://lkp25.github.io/ADVANCED-TO-DO-LIST-application/



My first vanilla JS project.
Design and all applied styles are my own idea. 
It may sound trivial but this to-do list is quite advanced actually (as far as to-do lists are concerned :) ). 


Functionality:
- adding single tasks (only limited number is allowed, a modal message will show if exceeded)
- deleting single tasks with corresponding icon or all with one button
- filtering of existing tasks using 'search field' - updates with every keydown event and displays only tasks matching search string
- animated, customizable modal window JS-object used twice in this project to display 2 different alerts (when user tries to add "empty task" and when there are too many tasks 
on the list)
- all the items are stored in local storage, so they are not gone when page reloads.

External resources used:
- working with SVG file icon downloaded from FontAwesome (for deleting single task from list) and external CDN - materialize.io icon (for closing the modal window) - to practice different click-event targets
- using Google-Fonts for handwriting-like font
